      <h2>About our startup</h2>
      <p>
        We’re a Sydney-based startup founded by four high school girls who believe
        finding part-time work should be simple, fair, and accessible for students.
        Our platform connects students with flexible opportunities that fit around school and life.

      <p>
        What started as a school project quickly grew into a community-focused platform.
        We talked to students, parents, and local businesses across Sydney, and built a solution
        that’s lightweight, mobile-first, and easy to use. Every feature is designed around student needs.
